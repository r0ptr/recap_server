  INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------

That version of Ressurection Capsule is still not functional for playing the game;
although, it can be used to play with the hero editor already.

You need to find the Darkspore.exe. Depending of your Darkspore version, 
its folder will be different:

- DVD/Latest version: C:\Program Files (x86)\Electronic Arts\Darkspore\DarksporeBin
- Steam version: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Darkspore\DarksporeBin

Copy the `patch_darkspore_exe.exe` file from the patcher folder (from the ReCap 
release) to the DarksporeBin folder. Run the copied `patch_darkspore_exe.exe` file, 
and a new window should pop up; you can close after the success message appears. 
A new file should appear in the DarksporeBin folder after that, the 
Darkspore_local.exe. Use it to launch Darkspore.

Now launch darkspore_server.exe, and while running it, launch Darkspore with
Darkspore_local.exe, and keep both of them running. 

Press Play in the Darkspore launcher and wait for the login screen. 
Using the Register button in the Darkspore login screen, create a user account 
(it will only exist in your computer, and you won't need internet to do that). 
After creating the user, login with it. You should be able to use the hero 
editor, which is as far as we could go until this day (25/04/2020).

In case you are reading that and over 2 or 3 months have passed, check if there
isn't any more recent version of ReCap already.



------------------------------------------------------------------
  UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you already have an older version of ReCap, you just need to replace the older
version files with the ones from that version. 

You can keep your users by preserving the original storage/users folder, but I don't
recommend it, because the structure of the user file may still change.
